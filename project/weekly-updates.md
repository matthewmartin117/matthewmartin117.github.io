# Weekly Project Updates

## Week 1
- [ ] Planned project scope  
- [ ] Drafted proposal  

## Week 2
- [ ] Setup repo  
- [ ] Learn base Java concepts
- [ ] Set up core functionality of app; classes and file structure

## Week 3 
- [ ] Create a timeline for key deliverables of the project
- [ ] Finalize project proposal
- [ ] Installing technologies and configuring dependencies

Reflection: I think having a clear timeline with key deliverables is key for this project, as it prevents me from spending more time than necessary , or less time than necessary because I know exactly what i need to have completed each week in order to have the project done in 10 weeks. 

## Week 4 
- [ ] Populate a Trello board with key features and deliverables, with the timeline.
- [ ] Bootstrap the project using Maven, create a file structure and include Spring Boot dependencies.
- [ ] Design modular classes for the Data Model aspect of my project, produce an entity relational diagram.

Reflection: The biggest obstacles so far have been time , but I decided to invest more time in the project than necessary since I am a part time student, so I have the free time to allocate towards the project. The other obstacle was creating actionable clear deliverables so I know what i need to do when i sit down at my computer but getting Trello set up has solved that.
